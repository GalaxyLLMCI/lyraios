## 3. MCP Integration Details

### 3.1 MCP Protocol Overview

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a client-server architecture protocol for connecting LLM applications and integrations. In MCP:

- **Hosts** are LLM applications (such as Claude Desktop or IDE) that initiate connections
- **Clients** maintain a 1:1 connection with servers in host applications
- **Servers** provide context, tools, and prompts to clients

### 3.2 MCP Function Support

LYRAIOS supports the following MCP functions:

- **Resources**：Allow attaching local files and data
- **Prompts**：Support prompt templates
- **Tools**：Integrate to execute commands and scripts
- **Sampling**：Support sampling functions (planned)
- **Roots**：Support root directory functions (planned)

### 3.3 Tool Integration Protocol

The tool integration protocol is a key component of the LYRAIOS open protocol architecture, providing a standardized way to integrate third-party tools and services.

#### Key Features:

- **Standardized Tool Manifest**：Use JSON schema to define tool capabilities, parameters, and requirements
- **Plug-and-Play Adapter System**：Support different types of tools (REST API, Python plugins, etc.)
- **Secure Execution Environment**：Tools run in a controlled environment with resource limits and permission checks
- **Version and Dependency Management**：Track tool versions and dependencies
- **Monitoring and Logging**：Comprehensive logging of tool execution

#### Tool Integration Process:

1. **Define Tool Manifest**：Create a JSON file describing tool capabilities
2. **Implement Tool**：Develop tool functionality according to the protocol
3. **Register Tool**：Use API to register tools to LYRAIOS
4. **Use Tool**：Tools are now available to LYRAIOS agents

## 4. Data Flow

### 4.1 User Request Processing Flow

1. User sends request through the interface layer
2. Core OS layer receives the request and processes it
3. If external tool support is needed, the request is forwarded to the MCP integration layer
4. MCP client connects to the corresponding MCP server
5. External service executes the request and returns the result
6. The result is returned to the user through each layer

### 4.2 Tool Execution Flow

1. AI Agent determines that a specific tool is needed
2. Tool registry looks up tool definition and capabilities
3. Tool executor prepares execution environment
4. Adapter converts request to tool-understandable format
5. Tool executes and returns the result
6. The result is returned to the AI Agent for processing

## 5. Security Considerations
